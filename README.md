# WrathExtended
Patch 3.4 and onwards, a thought experiment what could have been.
Code is here https://github.com/PolarCookie/TrinityCore/tree/3.4.0+

# Patch 3.4
## Classes
### Warlock
+ **Pandemic** now applies crit ability to Curse of Agony, Drain Life and Drain Soul, applies crit buff to Seed of Corruption
> CoA, Drain Life and Drain Soul not critting is an asymmetry which severly hurts crit rating for affliction warlocks, where crit/spirit gear becomes garbage to be avoided. Same with the crit multiplier not being present on SoC.

+ **Seed of Corruption** now is a single target AoE DoT.
> I personally find the 3.3.5 SoC to be incredibly boring, all you do is spam or spam-tab and pray tanks can hold agro. It doesn't synergise nicely with anything in the warlock arsenal, except Shadowflame if you want to trigger them. It is a massive break from the usuall affliction rotation of managing DoTs and debuffs. It belongs to a spec designed around building up damage potetion which is triggered, not affliction which ramps up steady non-burst damage. This new version is like regular Corruption except that the damage is AoE. The envisioned AoE rotation will be SoC, run towards the enemies while spreading regular Corruption, Shadowflame (as  will now trigger Everlasting Affliction) and then tab casting SB/haunt to keep up all dots.
+ **Glyph of Quick Decay** now affects Seed of Corruption.
+ **Everlasting Affliction** now refreshes Seed of Corruption and can be triggered by Shadowflame.
> Shadowflame triggering Everlasting Affliction is something I wish I had in many cases. Affliction AoE has been limited to either SoC, boring as previously mentioned, or tab casting Corruption on all targets which is a slow, tedious and difficult task to get right. No other class has any AoE rotation as intricate as affli multidotting on 4+ targets.
+ **Shadow Bite** is an On-Next-Auto-Attack type spell, like Heroic Strike.
> This is in preperation for later pet changes where all pets will get 100% haste, crit, penetration, hit/expertise ratings from their masters. It is not needed that Felhunter should do a physical melee attack, and it's asymmetrical as the melee attack suffers from armor and glancing blows.
